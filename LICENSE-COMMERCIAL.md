# COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

**go-objstore**

---

## IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY

THIS COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (EITHER AN INDIVIDUAL OR A SINGLE ENTITY, "Licensee") AND AUTOMATE THE THINGS, LLC ("Licensor"). BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

### Why Choose the Commercial License?

The go-objstore software is dual-licensed under AGPL-3.0 (free, open source) and this Commercial License (paid). The key difference is:

**AGPL-3.0 (Free)** requires you to:
- Disclose your source code if you provide the software as a network service
- Release any modifications under AGPL-3.0
- Provide complete corresponding source to users
- Cannot use in proprietary/closed-source products

**Commercial License (This Agreement)** provides:
- **Freedom to modify** the software without disclosure obligations
- **Freedom to rebrand and white-label** with your own branding
- **Freedom to deploy** as SaaS, cloud services, or network applications without source disclosure
- **Freedom to integrate** into proprietary products and services
- **No copyleft restrictions** on your applications
- **Professional support options** available
- **Legal indemnification** and warranty provisions

This commercial license is ideal for businesses that want to use go-objstore in proprietary software, SaaS platforms, or commercial products without the restrictions of the AGPL-3.0 license.
