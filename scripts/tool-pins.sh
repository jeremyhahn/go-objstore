# shellcheck shell=sh disable=SC2034
# tool-pins.sh — the pins of the analysis tools the devcontainer's toolchain
# image carries. Sourced, never run.
#
# Read by the devcontainer's tools stage (scripts/install-tools.sh sources it)
# and by the Makefile, which feeds the file into the toolchain image's content
# tag. NAME=value lines only, comments on their own lines: the file is both
# make and sh, and make would keep a trailing comment's leading space in the
# value.
#
# Every pin tracks the tool's latest upstream release; a pin exists only so a
# build is reproducible. Never @latest, never an older version than upstream's.
#
# Raise with `go list -m github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2@latest`, and the
# Makefile's GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION with it.

GOSEC_VERSION=v2.29.0
# gosec is built against this x/tools: the v0.49.0 its go.mod names cannot read
# the export data (version 5) Go 1.27 writes, so every import fails to type-check.
XTOOLS_VERSION=v0.52.0
# Raise with `go list -m golang.org/x/vuln@latest`.

#
# trivy and shellcheck are release archives pinned by four SHA-256s each: the
# archive per Linux arch and the binary inside it (see scripts/install-tools.sh).
# Raise a version and all four of its hashes together, or not at all.
#
# trivy's archive hashes are from the release's trivy_0.75.0_checksums.txt.
